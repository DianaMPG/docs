# Interacting with the data in OpenSpending

Raw fiscal data gets boring fast. That is why visualisation is such an important part of OpenSpending. When you explore the database, you'll eventually stumble on a data package of interest to you. Clicking through to look at this data package in detail, you'll get to an app that we call the "Viewer". It presents a number of ways to interact with the data in the package, via easy-to-use charts and tables.

## Walkthroughs

1. Now that you have opened your data package in OS Viewer, you can interact with the tool to a. explore your data; b. apply filters; c. create a desired visualization; d. download the data package or View Raw Source Data; or e. Analyze the data set in the Data Mine.
