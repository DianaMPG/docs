# Interacting with the data in OpenSpending

Raw fiscal data gets boring fast. That is why visualisation is such an important part of OpenSpending. When you explore the database, you'll eventually stumble on a data package of interest to you. Clicking through to look at this data package in detail, you'll get to an app that we call the "Viewer". It presents a number of ways to interact with the data in the package, via easy-to-use charts and tables.

## Walkthroughs

### Interacting with a data package

{
pre. we start with a data package loaded into the Viewer, based on the output of the previous "Explore" section.
1. Explain the default UI, with controls, a table, and an empty workspace.
2. Add a single view on the data. Explain how it limits the controls and the additional views that can be added.
3. Remove the single view to revert to default state.
4. Add another view of a different "type". Explain view types.
5. Add additional views to co-locate with the one that has been added.
6. Show how this whole viewer can be shared directly; or, embedded.
7. Show how individual vis can also be embedded.
