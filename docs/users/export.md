# Exporting data from OpenSpending

We've found that quite a few people want to get the raw data from OpenSpending. A common use case for the raw data is to look at it through tools that are more familiar, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. No problem! All the data in OpenSpending is stored in CSV files. You can export these files and then use them in other desktop applications.
